Prime example, I have not been doing my lunchtime routine at all. Out of my daily keystone habits, the one I seem to be doing consistently are my daily walks which are closing my activity rings, I do tend to drink 2L of water, I do complete my Anki cards. But that's about it annoyingly. Actually I'lln unctotell you what, I've had one of those days today where I've really not been myself, I knew it before it had begun, I couldn't concentrate this morning, felt incredibly tired, and I have ended up spending most of the day just plowing through books on system design. Now at first that sounds productive but it's not, it's not done from a place of control and relaxation, it's from a place of obsession and anxiety. For example, I have been stressing about the amount I have to read to prepare for the system design interview. I've had this conversation with myself many many times, there are a finite number of hours in the day, and an even smaller number where I have the mental capacity to actually work. I have systems to deal with this, it's two hours in the morning, possibly three. And really, I need to stick to that. It's hard because I feel that if I don't make the most of this opportunity for Monzo I'll have wasted my shot, and for that reason I'm allowing myself a short elastic burst of effort to go beyond my normal routine. The problem is of course that I've been \"elastically\" bursting for maybe four or five months now! I did that to meet my goals for the MSc, and I didn't really take a break afterwards before starting to prepare for a new job. So here I am, at the end of the Monzo process, working on hard on bringing myself up to speed on system design as best as possible, but trying hard not to \"waste\" my whole week on it because it's my week off and I wanted to also relax and achieve other things (DIY). So I'm admitting that today was a bit of an uncontrolled one, where I got a bit carried away and made myself anxious with the amount I decided I needed to read, but going forwards I'll try very hard to go back to my normal routine with just an extra hour or two to boost my preparation.

A less negative view is that it's knowledge that I've now learned and will be useful regardless, so nothing learned is ever wasted. A more practical and insightful view would say that these interviews are very hard to prepare for and actually practicing problem solving may be more appropriate. I probably have the base knowledge, but reviewing system design interviews and doing them myself in a practice setting, including leetcode, is probably the best way to prepare. And not just prepare, but become a better problem solver generally, it's very tied up with how to think more critically and creatively. I already have a system in place for this, it's a system I've not really followed through on but maybe this is a wakeup call to nail this part of my life. Understand and build mental models. Understand and create strategies for thinking through problems. Practice problems like leetcode, and practice problems like System Design. Beyond that, I don't think much else would have helped (except for perhaps getting a good nights sleep but I'm not going to beat myself up for that.) I'm actually feeling surprisingly positive, but not because I think I've passed, I actually am mostly expecting to fail and I will be dissapointed (part of me is deparately hoping for a similar result to what I got with Sharon where I thought it had gone shit but ended up passing), but honestly I think that system design review really didn't go well.

I completed the first coding exercise but did not get to the second. So, lots of thoughts going around my head, am I a failure, do I not have what it takes to get these jobs? Am I defined by getting these jobs, etc. Basically, no, my purpose is to build great tech that makes an impact, I don't NEED to be at one of these companies for that to happen. Also as I've told myself multiple times, it's a numbers game, and I can simply keep applying. In order to best prepare for these interviews, I absolutely cannot \"burst prepare\" like I did with Monzo, because that didn't actually help at all. My strategy, which I've already figured out a long time ago, is to build up a huge knowledge base in Anki (I need to deal with the deluge of extra cards I've added over the last few weeks), and practice problem solving. This is, I think, the single best way to do it. I need to be regularly consuming tech books and Ankifying the results, and staying on top of that knowledge, but it must be sustainable, with a maximum of two new cards a day as planned. The missing part is problem solving in system design, and also problem solving with programming, which is actually what tripped me up today in both applications. Amazon was directly problem solving with coding, but actually that's what Monzo wanted to dig into as well, they literally didn't seem to care about what tech I was choosing, whether it was sharded, partitioned, etc. I mentioned Kafka and they nodded, but they wanted me to communicate the design and be clear on the algorithm. Fucking algorithms.. so leetcode unfortunately seems to have become much more important? One a day? Half an hour a day? Is that reasonable? Watching of system design interviews? I really liked Hello Interview that had a good channel, good content, and a cool AI powered practice environment. Maybe I just do that. For how long? Well.. forever, or at least until further notice.

I have the offer from Monzo. The offer is good, very good. 95K which is almost 20K higher than my current salary, plus a 70K options package which (unlike Vaarst or Ultraleap) has a serious chance of actually paying off. And yet, I feel trepidation. I think it's because it's a leap, as it always is. I know this is the right thing to do but I just want to get some thoughts down to convince myself. Firstly, the pay and financial prospects are much better at Monzo, I will be much better off in the future if I go with them, there is no way I can match this in Bristol, this will fund our future lifestyle. Second, the paternity leave is incredible, 13 weeks (not 2 like at Ultraleap) and for the plans Susie and I have it's very aligned. I can take a 3 month paid sabbatical in five years (or an unpaid one in 2 years) which aligns more with my wanting to take time off in big chunks. So, package wise, the benefits are much greater. Second, it's a London life, which is something I think I want for a while, but even better, it's remote first! So I don't HAVE to go in to the office, I can be fully remote, but I can choose to go in to the exciting, techy London office when I choose. This is the best of both worlds, I can do the things I have in my head, spend time in London, see Arnaud, go to tech meetups, build a reputation and make connections, I can go to Google (Harriet said she and a staff engineering simply.. went to google one friday, clearly Monzo is connected) and hang out, and I can network and bond with engineers from other big tech companies and really get into the scene, I can't do that still at Ultraleap. I can also see more of Lucy and Nathan, I can travel more, stay in cooler airbnbs, I like the idea of taking the train to London, it's impressive, I can see Louis more, and meet up with people. This is an exciting part of my life that I'd miss out on if I stayed in Bristol, the good news is that Bristol is still my home base so I'm not losing anything here either. Third, Monzo is an impressive badge, there is prestige around it. I can have Monzo on my CV, I can work for a place people know, I can work for an impressive unicorn tech startup, what an opportunity. This is also a potential bridge into big tech, I can go from here to Google, to OpenAI, etc if I wanted to. But really, working for Monzo would be an impressive piece of credibility and a launching point for future roles like CTO roles and engineering tech leads and managers wherever I choose. Fourth, it's an awesome place to learn. I will be learning a new language Go, new database Cassandra, new architecture style Event Based with a huge microservices platform, and I'll be learning what it's like to operate in a company serving tens of millions of users. That's not something I've done at Ultraleap or Vaarst. It will make me a much better engineer. I'll be surrounded by very capable people DIRECTLY IN MY TARGET AREA OF EXPERTISE, not surrounded by ML people at Ultraleap which I know I don't want to go into, in reality I can only learn from Guy at Ultraleap, which I have done, but at Monzo I can learn from my team more directly. The fifth and final reason, is it represents the next step in my perceived path (which to be fair I am still figuring out). I think my path is to be the best engineer I can be, to be excellent, to be a ten times engineer, to become a renowned technical leader who is great at their craft. I miss what I did at Vaarst, but at Monzo I can rise through the ranks to do that again, in a much more prestigious company. So it's definitely a step in the right direction. What are the downsides? Well, there is risk that I join and fail the probation, but that's my usual fear talking. I had this same fear at Ultraleap, and at Vaarst. They wouldn't have hired me if they didn't think I had what it takes. So it's a very small risk, and worse case it would be december when I'd have to look for another job so by being sensible financially I can create a huge buffer for safety. Another downside, what if this is a step in the wrong direction? It's a step away from ML. Maybe it's a step away from the fast paced world of startup scrabbling into a big, corporate, more bounded environment with less opportunity to get involved in all sorts of cool initiatives. No, it's not. That's a silly perspective, Monzo and other big tech companies are going to even more opportunistic for the right people, there's going to be tonnes of cool stuff to get involved in, Monzo is all about the impact and the technical skill, and the behavioural stuff, this is MORE aligned and appropriate than Ultraleap, not the other way around. I have a fear that I'll become less employable because I'll have done less recent stuff, for example at Ultraleap I can claim an incredible piece of experience, to have rebuilt the MLOps platform, also at Vaarst I had a story to tell of being the ML Engineer who shipped a product then built a team around them to lead it. That's my brand. At Monzo might I lose that brand? No, firstly, you still have that stuff that you've done, that doesn't go away. Secondly, at Monzo you have the opportunity to create that new story, a bad outcome would be if you went there and did nothing notable for three years then left and no story to tell and had to fall back on Ultraleap. The chances of that are tiny, as long as you do what you're good at and play your cards right. So you'll have achieved more at Monzo and have more to talk about than before, it will make you more well rounded. So, the negatives are not really negatives, there are so many more positives. There is one more positive as well, number six, it's a chance to reset. I wanted this chance at Vaarst which is why I was excited about joining Ultraleap and redefining who I was. This worked initially and then I let it slip, I am in a reasonable position, but could have been so much more. At Monzo, this is my chance (maybe my last chance) to do this again, to get in, to impress, to make a name for myself, to not get distracted, to focus and be excellent, and to become the person I've always known I will be.", "mood": 5, "actions": "Remember to decide on a time to go to bed every day;Make a list of priorities and goals to convince myself about accepting the job offer from Monzo;Ensure to play your cards right and achieve more to have a notable story at Monzo", "entry": "118b8f7c-31d2-48ae-96ab-7698f0b9d4dd", "tags": ["a462be94-3a40-4082-a30d-5e126b9e6edc"]}, {"id": "1ed46f4c-9641-46a7-85d6-2580009d418d", "created_at": "2024-05-22T17:05:50.630594Z", "updated_at": "2024-05-22T17:06:16.742035Z", "content": "More news - Palantir responded!

I've been round loads of ideas, most really complex, it's a fucking hard problem. But I just stumbled upon a potentially very simple idea, it builds a bit on the store idea but it's orthogonal to it. So firstly, we massively simplify pipelines. If we implement the store idea above, then pipelines is freed from having to copy config around, it only ever copies parent task UUIDs across. This makes the pipeline much easier to reason about, and the config is much more explicit. So I liked that idea, but the problem was that to do parallel properly, the pipeline needs to know about what to parallalise over, and so I want coming up with all sorts of complicated ways to implement this, map reduce etc. But actually how about this, to make a task parallel you simply give it a count key with a value, like count: 10 which says create ten copies of that task. As simple as that, very easy mental model. They're all identical to each other, receive all the same config, have the same parents etc. So how do we meaningfully split up the work in this model? You leave it up to the task designer, all you need to do is make sure you tell them what number they are from 1 to 10, which is something the pipeline knows and can inject, perhaps as a config option.", "mood": null, "actions": "Simplify pipeline implementation by using the 'count' key to create parallel tasks with identical configuration;Inform task designers to number their tasks from 1 to N for meaningful work distribution", "entry": "2add0ca4-c3d3-4349-811a-d01e3cfbc01b", "tags": ["182ab9a7-a9af-4c02-aa04-0750a4ef3b9c"]}, {"id": "2957765b-ed9e-475d-aad3-e692ecee0000", "created_at": "2024-06-08T06:25:58.822450Z", "updated_at": "2024-06-08T06:29:02.773464Z", "content": "Streaming Systems is a complicated beast, it\u2019s like DDIA in the sense that it\u2019s full of complex concepts and it\u2019s a tough read, but it\u2019s completely foundational.

I also managed an early morning walk, that's important otherwise I won't get them done. I'm aiming for one a day. The rest of the day has been fairly chilled, I helped Julia out with preparing for the Sway Open Gardens which is tomorrow, the whole day tomorrow will be helping out with that (at least from 11am, I'll do my walk in the morning again). I spent a bit of time faffing with Continuum, creating a mobile application. Forgot how painful building mobile apps can be, nothing plays together. I'm using Threads to capture that work and progress. I'm liking threads, that approach seems like it's working. I feel a little bit of achievement anxiety today, actually order anxiety as well, I've felt a bit muddled. Possibly coming off the back of several days of unhealthy drinking and sleeping. On that note, I've been very healthy today, I've eaten less, (although I am going to cave and have some toast in a minute), but my calories are way down, I didn't have any beers I got Trip cans instead. I'm aiming for 80kgs now, hopefully I've blown straight past 85, which is awesome if I have because I was 89 a few weeks ago. THe key will be to keep the calories down, and stick to my small breakfasts and lunches. As for the anxiety stuff, it's hard. Whats on my mind is that I have about 2.5 months to Monzo, when Monzo starts I know it will be busy, so I want to a) get some relaxation in now and enjoy the next few months, but b) I also want to prepare effectively and hit the ground running, and c) I don't want to relax for a few months and then get taken by surprise. So my plan has been to get into a solid routine now, early morning work periods, late night reading sessions, meditation at lunchtime, and practice my systems to get them under control. Systems like writing this journal write now. The anxiety comes from not feeling like I'm doing any of that. But actually, now I reflect on it, it's not true, I am doing it, just not as much or thoroughly as I want to be, but I'll build that up. I think the chaos anxiety I'm feeling is because I've been changing my systems, I feel a bit flustered at having to relearn them. I have 2.5 months to really nail my habits. All of that is true but also this is just low level anxiety caused by less good sleep than usual, so I need to sleep more, and rest, and meditate, and just relax a bit, and everything will be fine.", "mood": null, "actions": "Remember to help out with Sway Open Gardens preparation tomorrow;Decide on a solid routine for early morning work, late night reading, and meditation at lunchtime;Increase focus on building and sticking to new habits in preparation for upcoming busy period at Monzo", "entry": "64e0a2c2-aa47-42be-a3d4-710b81eb1d6a", "tags": ["8e0acbb0-1c6e-4ea5-a6ce-f8dac7d80c5e"]}, {"id": "b7560303-cef4-4f73-a61a-53b71949cc69", "created_at": "2024-06-09T09:00:50.015691Z", "updated_at": "2024-06-09T18:05:32.032359Z", "content": "Nice walk this morning in the new forest, very sunny, was walking around just soaking everything in.
